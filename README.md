## Request your own USRBG
Option 1:
* Join this Discord Server > [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb), use a bot command in [#background-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/) and wait for approval.

Option 2:
* Make a pull request and wait for it to be merged.

**All requests are processed manually** by a select few theme developers (as of right now). You should expect to **wait a short amount of time before** your background **is added.**

All requests **MUST** be hosted on **i.imgur.com** or **cdn.discordapp.com**, or **unsplash.com**. Selfhosting will not be allowed, as this causes a security vulnerability when mass-distributing content to users.

## Importing the Database

```css
@import url('https://discord-custom-covers.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [Snippets](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg/tree/master/snippets) folder of this repo.

## Requirements
If you are using BetterDiscord, you **MUST have a plugin by [DevilBro](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons) running**, as **USRBG requires his lib** for certain important data attributes. *I've been nagging zere for while to add attributes to BD natively, but for the time being this is how we have to do it.*
