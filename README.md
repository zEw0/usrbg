## Requirements
If you are using BetterDiscord, you **MUST have a plugin by [DevilBro](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons) running**, as **USRBG requires his lib** for certain important data attributes. *I've been nagging zere for while to add attributes to BD natively, but for the time being this is how we have to do it.*
